# Age Group Prediction Model

## Overview

This project aims to predict the age group of users based on various features such as user agent, provider, URL, and location data. The model is trained using data from two providers, and an ensemble learning approach with Random Forest, Extra Trees, and Gradient Boosting classifiers is used for prediction.
